potential next plans:

#pizzaListTemplate, for collection rendering
checkboxes for toppings
on click #order, grabs all titles of checked boxes and adds to topping array. default topping is 'Cheese'
click also unchecks all checkboxes

new pizza model view displays toppings as dropdown menu

add pizza image. maybe new table column for .image button.
on click .image, shows pizza image with that model's toppings (randomly?) places on pizza
not sure how to display/remove pizza image. loop through toppings array and topping.show each?
can also display NAME's Pizza and auto-hide after x seconds?
